# Master Plan: Claude Accounts CRUD System

## Executive Summary
This master plan outlines the implementation of a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for managing Claude accounts within the admin panel of the Claude AWS Account Marketplace. The implementation is divided into two parallel workstreams that can be developed simultaneously to reduce overall delivery time.

## Project Overview

### Goal
Provide administrators with a comprehensive interface to manage Claude API accounts, including the ability to:
- View all Claude accounts with filtering and sorting
- Create new Claude accounts with encrypted API keys
- Edit existing account details and settings
- Delete accounts with proper audit trails
- Track usage and manage account tiers

### Architecture
The system follows the existing Next.js application architecture with:
- **Backend**: RESTful API with Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React-based admin pages with TypeScript
- **Security**: JWT authentication, encrypted storage, audit logging
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components

## Parallel Implementation Strategy

### Why Parallel Development?
1. **Backend and Frontend Independence**: The API contract can be defined upfront, allowing both teams to work simultaneously
2. **Reduced Time to Market**: Parallel development can reduce delivery time by 40-50%
3. **Better Resource Utilization**: Different skill sets can be utilized concurrently
4. **Early Integration Testing**: Mock data can be used for frontend while backend is in development

### Workstream Division

#### Workstream 1: Backend API Development
**Team Requirements**: Backend developer with Node.js/Prisma experience

**Deliverables**:
1. Database schema and migrations
2. CRUD API endpoints
3. Business logic and validation
4. Security implementation
5. Unit and integration tests

**Timeline**: 8 hours

#### Workstream 2: Frontend Admin Pages
**Team Requirements**: Frontend developer with React/Next.js experience

**Deliverables**:
1. Admin page components
2. Data table with sorting/filtering
3. Create/Edit forms
4. UI components and styling
5. API integration layer
6. Component tests

**Timeline**: 14 hours

### Coordination Points

#### Day 1: Contract Definition
Both teams meet to finalize:
- API endpoint specifications
- Request/response formats
- Validation rules
- Error response structure

#### Day 2-3: Independent Development
- Backend: Implement database and API
- Frontend: Build UI with mock data

#### Day 4: Integration Point
- Backend provides staging API
- Frontend switches from mock to real API
- Joint debugging session

#### Day 5: Final Integration
- End-to-end testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates

## Technical Specifications

### Data Model
```typescript
interface ClaudeAccount {
  id: string;
  apiKey: string;          // Encrypted
  accountName: string;
  email?: string;
  organization?: string;
  status: 'ACTIVE' | 'SUSPENDED' | 'EXPIRED' | 'PENDING';
  tier: 'FREE' | 'PRO' | 'ENTERPRISE';
  usageLimit?: number;
  currentUsage: number;
  features?: Record<string, any>;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### API Contract
```typescript
// List endpoint
GET /api/v1/admin/claude-accounts
Query: { page, limit, sortBy, sortOrder, search, status, tier }
Response: { data: ClaudeAccount[], pagination: {...} }

// Get single
GET /api/v1/admin/claude-accounts/:id
Response: { data: ClaudeAccount }

// Create
POST /api/v1/admin/claude-accounts
Body: { apiKey, accountName, email?, organization?, tier?, usageLimit? }
Response: { data: ClaudeAccount }

// Update
PUT /api/v1/admin/claude-accounts/:id
Body: Partial<ClaudeAccount> (excluding id, apiKey)
Response: { data: ClaudeAccount }

// Delete
DELETE /api/v1/admin/claude-accounts/:id
Response: { success: true }
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2)
**Backend**:
- Set up database schema
- Create basic CRUD endpoints
- Implement validation

**Frontend**:

### Phase 2: Core Features (Days 2-3)
**Backend**:
- Add authentication checks
- Implement encryption
- Add audit logging

**Frontend**:
- Build data table
- Create forms
- Add filtering/sorting

### Phase 3: Integration (Days 3-4)
**Both Teams**:
- Connect frontend to backend
- Fix integration issues
- Add error handling

### Phase 4: Polish (Days 4-5)
**Backend**:
- Performance optimization
- Additional validation
- Documentation

**Frontend**:
- UI polish
- Loading states
- Accessibility

### Phase 5: Testing (Day 5)
**Both Teams**:
- End-to-end testing
- Performance testing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **API Contract Changes**
   - Mitigation: Lock down contract early, version APIs
   
2. **Integration Issues**
   - Mitigation: Use shared TypeScript types, early integration tests

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination early, optimize queries

### Process Risks
1. **Communication Gaps**
   - Mitigation: Daily standups, shared Slack channel

2. **Dependency Delays**
   - Mitigation: Mock services, feature flags

3. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Clear requirements, change control process

## Conclusion

This master plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the Claude Accounts CRUD system. By following the parallel development approach and maintaining clear communication between teams, we can deliver a robust, secure, and user-friendly solution in minimal time. The modular architecture ensures that each component can be developed, tested, and deployed independently while maintaining system coherence.

The two separate issue documents provide detailed technical specifications for each workstream, allowing teams to work independently while following a common vision. Regular synchronization points ensure smooth integration and timely delivery of the complete system.
